The wind howled outside as Max held up the glowing map. "It says the treasure is hidden under the old tree stump," he whispered, eyes wide.
Luna, his little sister, tugged on his sleeve. "But it's almost midnight. What if the Night Guardian sees us?"
Max grinned. "That’s why we have the cloak of whispers!" He tossed a silvery cloth over their heads.
They tiptoed through the backyard, past the sleepy garden gnomes and under the creaky fence.
Suddenly - CRACK! A branch snapped behind them.
Luna jumped. “Did you hear that?”
Max froze. “Stay low.”
From the shadows, a shape emerged. It was only their cat, Nimbus, his tail puffed up like a bottlebrush.
Relieved, they crept to the ancient tree stump. Max rolled the map open again. “Three knocks, it says.”
He knocked once. Twice. On the third—
BOOM! Thunder shook the sky.
The stump creaked and slid open to reveal stairs spiraling downward.
Luna whispered, “Do we… go down?”
Max took her hand. “We go together.”
And with that, they vanished into the secret underground.
