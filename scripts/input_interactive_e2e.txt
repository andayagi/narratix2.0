# The Last Train Home

Maya slid into the diner booth across from her brother, steam rising from untouched coffee cups between them.

"You're really going through with this?" Jake whispered.

"The eviction notice came yesterday. What choice do I have?"

"You could stay with me and Sarah."

Maya's laugh was bitter. "Your wife barely tolerates me for an hour. You want me living there?"

"She'll understand. Family is family."

"Is it? Because family doesn't wait three months to return calls."

Jake shifted uncomfortably. "I've been busy—"

"And I've been busy losing everything. The shop, the apartment, and apparently my brother too."

"That's not fair."

"What's not fair is calling you when Dad had his heart attack and getting voicemail. Finding out from Mom's neighbor that you bought a house."

"Maya, I wanted to tell you—"

"When? Between ignoring my texts or skipping the family dinners I stopped getting invited to?"

Jake ran his hands through his hair. "Sarah thought it would be awkward with you... struggling."

"Struggling." She repeated the word like it tasted bitter. "Is that what we're calling it?"

"You know what I mean."

"No. Tell me, Jake. Use your words."

"Fine. You're a mess. The drinking, failed relationships, business ideas that never work. Sarah didn't want that chaos around the baby."

Maya sat back like she'd been slapped. She pulled a crumpled envelope from her pocket. "Here's honesty for you. Train ticket to Portland. One way. I leave tomorrow."

"You don't know anyone in Portland."

"Exactly. Clean slate. No chaos for Sarah to worry about."

"Maya, wait—"

"Tell Mom and Dad I'll call. Or don't."

"Please, sit down. We can figure this out."

Maya paused. "You know what's funny? I thought maybe my big brother would fight for me. Say 'screw what Sarah thinks' and help me rebuild."

"I am trying to help—"

"No, you're trying to manage me. There's a difference."

She stood, leaving money on the table. "Take care of your family."

"You're my family too."

Maya's smile was sad and tired. "No. I'm your chaos. And chaos doesn't get a seat at the table."

The diner bell chimed as she walked into the cold night, leaving Jake alone with two untouched cups and words that couldn't be taken back.
