Lena and Amir were best friends—and treasure hunters in training.

One afternoon, they explored the ancient Pyramid of Numbers.

At the entrance, they found a glowing sign:

"To enter, solve the riddle:
I am a number. Multiply me by 4, you get 28. What am I?"

Lena whispered, “Let’s try... 4 times what equals 28?”

Amir counted on his fingers. “4... 8... 12... 16... 20... 24... 28! That’s seven times!”

“So the answer is 7!” Lena called.

The door creaked open.

Inside, a second riddle appeared on a golden wall:

"I hold treasure inside.
But only those who divide,
36 by 6, may pass and ride."

“That’s easy!” said Amir. “36 divided by 6 is...”

“Let’s check,” Lena said. She drew it in the dust:
“6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 — that’s 6 times. So 36 ÷ 6 = 6!”

The wall slid open, revealing a staircase.

At the top, one last puzzle glowed on a silver chest:

"Add me up:
Twelve gold coins,
Eight silver coins,
Plus five rubies in a row—
How many treasures do I show?"

“Twelve plus eight is twenty,” Lena said.
“Then add five more... twenty-five!”

Amir grinned. “Let’s open it.”

They pushed the chest lid—and inside sparkled exactly 25 shining treasures.

Lena laughed. “Math is magic!”

Amir high-fived her. “Next pyramid?”
