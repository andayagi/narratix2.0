Detective Nia sat at her desk when the phone rang.

“Emergency at Sunnydale School,” said the voice. “Thirty cupcakes are missing from the bake sale table!”

Nia grabbed her notebook. “I'm on it.”

She arrived just as the teacher, Mr. J, was counting what was left.
“We baked 48 cupcakes this morning,” he said, “but now there are only 18.”

Nia jotted in her notebook.
48 - 18 = ?
“That means… 30 cupcakes are missing.”

She looked around and spotted crumbs near the lockers.

“How many classes had access to the table?” she asked.

“Just three,” Mr. J replied. “Each class had 10 students.”

Nia nodded. “Three classes × 10 students = 30 students. That’s the exact number of missing cupcakes.”

“But would every student take one cupcake?” she wondered aloud.

Then she saw a clue—napkins with bite marks and numbers scribbled on them.

“Look!” said Nia. “One napkin says ‘2’, another says ‘3’. These aren’t random—some kids took more than one!”

She thought hard. “What if 10 students took 2 cupcakes each, and 5 students took just 1?”

(10 × 2) + (5 × 1) = 20 + 5 = 25 cupcakes.
“Still not enough.”

Then a small voice spoke up. It was Maya from Class 3.
“I took 3... I was really hungry.”

Aha!

Nia recalculated:
(8 × 2) + (4 × 1) + (2 × 3) = 16 + 4 + 6 = 26
Still not 30.

Then Mr. J gasped. “Wait! I ate 4 during lunch!”

Nia grinned.
“26 + 4 = 30! Mystery solved.”

Mr. J blushed. “Guess I owe the bake sale another batch.”

“Make it double,” Nia said, “just to be safe.”
