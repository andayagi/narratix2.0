Benny the Bear was building the tallest block tower he’d ever made. His tongue stuck out in concentration as he added the final piece.

"Don’t fall, don’t fall..." he whispered.

Just then, his little sister Bella ran by chasing a butterfly—CRASH!

The tower toppled into a pile of noisy blocks.

Benny's face turned red. His paws clenched. His chest puffed.

“BELLA!” he roared. “You ruined everything!”

Bella froze. “I didn’t mean to…”

Benny lifted his paw. He wanted to hit, just a little smack. But then—

“PAWS… PAUSE.”

He remembered.

He looked down at his paws and whispered, “Bears can stop. Bears can breathe.”

He stomped once. He squeezed a pillow nearby. And then he said:

“I’m really, really mad right now. I needed space.”

Bella’s eyes were big. “I’m sorry, Benny. Can I help you build it again?”

Benny took one more big breath.

“Okay,” he said quietly. “But this time, butterfly-chasing is banned from block zone!”

Bella giggled, and together they started again—this time, with two builders and zero bumps.
