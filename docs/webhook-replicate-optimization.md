# Webhook-Based Audio Generation Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks needed to optimize both sound effects and background music generation by replacing the current polling approach with Replicate webhooks. This will reduce generation times from 3-5 minutes to ~15 seconds per batch.

## Current Problem
- **Sound effects generation** takes 3+ minutes per effect due to polling Replicate API every 500ms
- **Background music generation** takes 5+ minutes per track due to polling every 700ms with 300-second timeout
- Sequential processing makes multiple audio generations even slower
- API responses are blocked during the entire polling period for both types

## Solution
Replace polling with webhooks for asynchronous processing and immediate API responses for both sound effects and background music generation.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Configuration Updates

#### 1.1 Update `utils/config.py`
- [x] Add `BASE_URL` configuration setting
- [x] Set default to `"http://localhost:8000"` for development
- [x] Add environment variable support: `os.getenv("BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`

```python
# Add to Settings.__init__()
self.BASE_URL = os.getenv("BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
```

### 2. Create Webhook Endpoint

#### 2.1 Create `api/endpoints/replicate_webhook.py`
- [x] Create new FastAPI router for webhook handling
- [x] Implement `/replicate-webhook/{content_type}/{content_id}` POST endpoint
  - `content_type`: "sound_effect" or "background_music"
  - `content_id`: effect_id or text_id respectively
- [ ] Add webhook signature verification (TODO for security)
- [x] Handle prediction status: succeeded, failed, canceled
- [x] Parse webhook payload to extract prediction.status and prediction.output
- [x] Route to appropriate processing function based on content_type
- [x] Use BackgroundTasks for async processing
- [x] Add proper error handling and logging

**Key features:**
- Unified webhook handling for both audio types
- Content-type routing
- Idempotent webhook handling
- Background task processing
- Proper error responses
- Logging for debugging

### 3. Service Layer Updates (DRY Architecture)

#### 3.1 Create Shared Audio Generation Infrastructure

##### 3.1.1 Create `services/replicate_audio.py` (NEW - Shared Logic)
- [x] Create `ReplicateAudioConfig` dataclass for generation parameters
- [x] Create `create_webhook_prediction()` function:
  - Takes config, content_type, content_id
  - Constructs webhook URL using BASE_URL
  - Calls replicate.predictions.create() with webhook
  - Returns prediction ID immediately
- [x] Create `process_webhook_result()` function:
  - Downloads audio from Replicate output URL
  - Handles temporary file creation/cleanup
  - Converts to base64
  - Routes to appropriate storage function based on content_type
- [x] Create `AudioPostProcessor` abstract base class:
  - `trim_audio()` method (for sound effects)
  - `store_audio()` method (abstract - implemented by subclasses)
  - `log_result()` method (abstract - implemented by subclasses)

##### 3.1.2 Create Audio Post-Processors
- [x] `SoundEffectProcessor(AudioPostProcessor)`:
  - Implements ffmpeg trimming logic
  - Implements `crud.update_sound_effect_audio()` storage
  - Implements sound effect logging
- [x] `BackgroundMusicProcessor(AudioPostProcessor)`:
  - Skips trimming (not needed)
  - Implements `crud.update_text_background_music_audio()` storage  
  - Implements background music logging

#### 3.2 Update Sound Effects Service (Simplified)

##### 3.2.1 Modify `generate_and_store_effect()` in `services/sound_effects.py`
- [x] Remove all polling logic (180-second loop)
- [x] Create `ReplicateAudioConfig` with sound effect parameters
- [x] Call shared `create_webhook_prediction("sound_effect", effect_id, config)`
- [x] Return immediately after webhook trigger

#### 3.3 Update Background Music Service (Simplified)

##### 3.3.1 Modify `generate_background_music()` in `services/background_music.py`
- [x] Remove all polling logic (300-second loop)
- [x] Create `ReplicateAudioConfig` with background music parameters
- [x] Call shared `create_webhook_prediction("background_music", text_id, config)`
- [x] Keep existing duration calculation logic
- [x] Return immediately after webhook trigger

**DRY Architecture Benefits:**
```python
# OLD: Duplicated polling in both services (400+ lines total)
# services/sound_effects.py: 180-second polling loop
# services/background_music.py: 300-second polling loop  

# NEW: Shared infrastructure (DRY pattern)
from services.replicate_audio import create_webhook_prediction, ReplicateAudioConfig

# Sound Effects (simplified):
config = ReplicateAudioConfig(
    version=model_version,
    input=input_params,
    duration=duration
)
create_webhook_prediction("sound_effect", effect_id, config)

# Background Music (simplified):
config = ReplicateAudioConfig(
    version="96af46316252ddea4c6614e31861876183b59dce84bad765f38424e87919dd85",
    input={
        "prompt": music_prompt,
        "duration": music_duration,
        "output_format": "mp3"
    }
)
create_webhook_prediction("background_music", text_id, config)
```

**Shared Webhook Processing:**
```python
# Single webhook handler routes to appropriate processor
def process_webhook_result(content_type: str, content_id: int, prediction_data: dict):
    processor = get_processor(content_type)  # Factory pattern
    processor.process_and_store(content_id, prediction_data)
```

### 4. API Integration

#### 4.1 Update `api/main.py`
- [x] Import new webhook router
- [x] Add router to app with `/api` prefix
- [x] Ensure proper order of router registration

```python
from .endpoints import ..., replicate_webhook
app.include_router(replicate_webhook.router, prefix="/api")
```

### 5. Database Updates (if needed)

#### 5.1 Check CRUD operations for Sound Effects
- [x] Verify `crud.update_sound_effect_audio()` exists and works correctly
- [x] Ensure proper handling of `audio_data_b64` field updates
- [x] Add any missing database operations

#### 5.2 Check CRUD operations for Background Music
- [x] Verify `crud.update_text_background_music_audio()` exists and works correctly
- [x] Ensure proper handling of `background_music_audio_b64` field updates
