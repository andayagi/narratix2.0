# Domain Service Interfaces Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of core domain service interfaces for the Narratix system.

## Overview

The domain service interfaces define the contracts for how different parts of the application interact with core functionalities. These interfaces promote loose coupling between components and enable easier testing and extension of the system.

## Implemented Interfaces

### TextAnalysisService

Interface for text analysis operations that handles text processing, analysis, and extraction of relevant features.

#### Key Methods:
- `analyze_text`: Extracts various features from text content.
- `identify_characters`: Identifies potential characters in the text.
- `detect_dialog`: Detects and extracts dialog segments with speaker attribution.
- `segment_text`: Segments text into logical narrative elements.
- `extract_sentiment`: Extracts sentiment metrics from text segments.

### VoiceManagementService

Interface for voice management operations that handles the management of voice profiles, including creation, retrieval, and association with characters.

#### Key Methods:
- `get_available_voices`: Retrieves all available voices.
- `get_voice_by_id`: Retrieves a specific voice by its ID.
- `filter_voices`: Filters voices based on criteria like gender, accent, etc.
- `assign_voice_to_character`: Assigns a voice to a character.
- `create_custom_voice`: Creates a new custom voice profile.
- `update_voice`: Updates an existing voice profile.

### AudioGenerationService

Interface for audio generation operations that handles the conversion of text to audio using specific voice profiles and adjustment parameters.

#### Key Methods:
- `generate_audio`: Generates audio for a text segment using a specified voice.
- `generate_narrative_audio`: Generates audio for a narrative element.
- `save_audio`: Saves audio data to a file.
- `generate_full_narration`: Generates audio for a full text content with multiple voices.
- `adjust_audio_properties`: Applies post-processing adjustments to audio.

## Testing

Unit tests have been implemented for all service interfaces. The tests verify:

1. Protocol conformance (each mock service implements all required methods).
2. Method functionality (each method returns expected data types).
3. Basic behavior (methods perform their intended operations correctly).

The test suite includes 19 individual tests across the three service interfaces, all of which are passing.

## Implementation Notes

- All interfaces use Python's Protocol classes (from typing module) to define abstract interfaces.
- Method signatures include comprehensive type hints for parameters and return values.
- Each method is documented with detailed docstrings in Google style format.
- The interfaces are designed to be implementation-agnostic, allowing for different concrete implementations without changing client code.

## Next Steps

1. Implement concrete service classes that fulfill these interfaces.
2. Develop integration tests for the concrete implementations.
3. Integrate the services into the application workflow.
4. Consider extending the interfaces if additional functionality is needed.
