   - ✅ Test file operations from Railway environment (test script created and run)
   - ✅ Fixed signature mismatch error by generating new R2 API credentials
   - ✅ All R2 operations working: connection, upload/download, list objects, audio files

### 4. Domain & SSL Configuration

**Estimated Time**: 0.5 days

4.1. **Domain Setup** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Configure custom domain in Railway (midsummerr.com)
   - ✅ Update DNS records configuration
   - ✅ Verify SSL certificate installation (verification script created)
   - ✅ Update CORS origins for production domain
   - ✅ Configure BASE_URL for production environment

4.2. **CORS Configuration** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Update CORS policies for production domain (midsummerr.com)
   - ✅ Configure API subdomain (api.midsummerr.com) for Railway deployment  
   - ✅ Test cross-origin requests - all endpoints responding
   - ✅ Verify preflight requests working with proper domain separation

### 5. Integration Testing & Validation
**Dependencies**: All above tasks complete  
**Estimated Time**: 0.5 days

5.1. **End-to-End Connectivity Tests** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Test all service integrations (Database, R2 Storage, APIs, FastAPI app)
   - ✅ Verify environment variables loaded correctly (all required and optional vars present)
   - ✅ Test database connections and basic queries (Neon PostgreSQL working with transactions)
   - ✅ Test file upload/download to R2 (upload, download, verification, cleanup working)
   - ✅ Test external API integrations (Anthropic, Hume, Replicate all accessible)
   - ✅ Test application health endpoints (basic, detailed, ready all working)
   - ✅ Created comprehensive end-to-end test script (`scripts/end_to_end_connectivity_test.py`)

5.2. **External API Integration Tests** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Test Anthropic Claude API connectivity (comprehensive text analysis functionality verified)
   - ✅ Test Hume AI API connectivity (API key validation and endpoint access verified)
   - ✅ Test Replicate API connectivity (authentication and audio model access verified)
