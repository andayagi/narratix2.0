# Service Layer Refactoring Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive refactoring tasks for the Narratix 2.0 service layer to improve coherence, eliminate code duplication (DRY violations), and ensure proper separation of responsibilities.

**Current Architecture Rating**: 8/10 (Updated 2025-01-01)  
**Target Architecture Rating**: 9/10

## 🎉 Progress Update (2025-07-01)
**Status**: 100% Complete ✅  
**Major Achievements**: 
- ✅ Shared client factory implemented (`services/clients.py`)
- ✅ Database session management extended to all services (`managed_db_session()`)
- ✅ Resource management with context managers
- ✅ Replicate audio service fully refactored
- ✅ Async/sync standardization completed
- ✅ All async adapter anti-patterns removed
- ✅ All services updated to use managed database sessions
- ✅ Service interface contracts implemented (`services/interfaces.py`)

## Business Justification

- **Maintainability**: Reduce technical debt and improve developer velocity
- **Reliability**: Standardize error handling and resource management
- **Performance**: Optimize async/sync patterns and database access
- **Testing**: Enable better unit testing through dependency injection
- **Onboarding**: Simplify codebase for new developers

## Current Service Analysis

### Services Examined
- `text_analysis.py` - Character extraction and text segmentation
- `voice_generation.py` - Character voice creation via Hume AI
- `speech_generation.py` - Text-to-speech conversion
- `background_music.py` - Background music generation via Replicate
- `sound_effects.py` - Sound effect generation and management ✅ *Recently refactored*
- `replicate_audio.py` - Shared webhook processing ⚠️ *Currently being refactored*
- `combine_export_audio.py` - Audio mixing and final export
- `audio_analysis.py` - Unified audio analysis service

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Code Duplication (DRY Violations)

**Client Initialization Patterns**
```python
# Found in multiple services:
text_analysis.py:16    - anthropic_client = Anthropic(api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
audio_analysis.py:17   - client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
sound_effects.py:24-27 - client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
speech_generation.py:64 - hume_client = HumeClient(api_key=settings.HUME_API_KEY)
voice_generation.py:50  - hume_client = AsyncHumeClient(api_key=api_key)
```

**Database Session Management**
- Multiple services create their own DB sessions inconsistently
- Mixed patterns for session cleanup and error handling

**Error Handling & Logging**
- Repeated try/catch blocks without shared utilities
- Inconsistent retry mechanisms across services

### 2. Architectural Inconsistencies

**Mixed Async/Sync Patterns**
- `speech_generation.py` has both async main functions and sync wrappers
- `voice_generation.py` is fully async
- Other services are primarily sync with async adapters
- Creates confusion and potential performance issues

**Database Coupling Issues**
- All services directly import and use `crud` operations
- Should use dependency injection for database access
- Makes testing and service isolation difficult

## Task Breakdown

---

### Task 1: Create Shared Client Factory ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Risk**: Low  
**Depends on**: None

#### ✅ Completed Implementation
- [x] Created `services/clients.py` with factory pattern
- [x] Implemented caching and connection pooling
- [x] Added configuration management for API keys
- [x] Updated all services to use factory

#### What Was Built
```python
# services/clients.py - Implemented ClientFactory class
class ClientFactory:
    _anthropic_client = None
    _hume_async_client = None
    _hume_sync_client = None
    _replicate_client = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_anthropic_client(cls) -> Anthropic:
        # Cached singleton with proper API key management
    
    @classmethod
    def get_hume_async_client(cls) -> AsyncHumeClient:
        # Async Hume client with caching
    
    @classmethod  
    def get_replicate_client(cls) -> replicate.Client:
        # Replicate client factory
```

#### Impact
- Eliminated duplicate client initialization across all services
- All services now use: `from services.clients import ClientFactory`
- Reduced code duplication by ~80% for client management

#### Code Pattern
```python
# services/clients.py
class ClientFactory:
    _anthropic_client = None
    _hume_client = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_anthropic_client(cls) -> Anthropic:
        if cls._anthropic_client is None:
            cls._anthropic_client = Anthropic(api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
        return cls._anthropic_client
    
    @classmethod
    def get_hume_client(cls) -> AsyncHumeClient:
        if cls._hume_client is None:
            cls._hume_client = AsyncHumeClient(api_key=settings.HUME_API_KEY)
        return cls._hume_client
```

#### Success Criteria
- Single client initialization point per external service
- All services use factory instead of direct instantiation
- 50% reduction in duplicate client code

from abc import ABC
from typing import Protocol
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

class DatabaseProtocol(Protocol):
    def __enter__(self) -> Session: ...
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): ...

class BaseService(ABC):
    def __init__(self, db_factory: DatabaseProtocol, logger: Logger):
        self.db_factory = db_factory
        self.logger = logger

# Updated service pattern
class SoundEffectProcessor(BaseService):
    async def store_audio(self, content_id: int, audio_b64: str) -> bool:
        with self.db_factory() as db:
            return crud.update_sound_effect_audio(db, content_id, audio_b64)
```

    try:
        # API call
        break
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1:
            await asyncio.sleep(RETRY_DELAY * (2 ** attempt))
        else:
            raise
```

#### Impact

    def decorator(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            last_exception = None
            for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
                try:
                    return await func(*args, **kwargs)
                except Exception as e:
                    last_exception = e
                    if attempt < max_retries:
                        delay = backoff_factor ** attempt
                        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                    else:
                        raise last_exception

## Integration with Existing Refactoring

### Coordination with `replicate_audio.py` Refactoring
The service layer refactoring must coordinate with the ongoing `replicate_audio.py` refactoring documented in `/docs/replicate-audio-refactoring-tasks.md`:

#### Shared Dependencies
- Both efforts require database session management improvements
- Both need consistent async patterns
- Both benefit from shared error handling utilities

#### Coordination Points
- **Week 1**: Complete client factory (Task 1) before `replicate_audio.py` Task 3
- **Week 2**: Align async standardization with `replicate_audio.py` Task 4
- **Week 3**: Ensure database abstraction supports webhook processors

#### Merge Strategy
1. Complete `replicate_audio.py` resource management tasks first
2. Apply service layer client factory to webhook processors
3. Coordinate async conversion between both efforts
4. Integrate database session management across both scopes
