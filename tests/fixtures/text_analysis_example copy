The café was almost empty when she sat across from me. Rain tapping at the windows, jazz humming low from the speakers. She didn’t take off her coat.
“You said it was urgent,” I said.
She slid a tiny brass key across the table. “It’s from his apartment.”
I didn’t touch it. “You’re not supposed to have that.”
She smiled like it hurt. “Neither are you, Detective.”
“I’m not a detective anymore.”
“You are tonight.”
I stared at the key. “He’s been dead three years.”
“And yet someone left that in my mailbox yesterday. No note. Just the key.”
I finally picked it up. Still warm, somehow. “You sure it’s his?”
“I used to live there,” she said. “I know what his keys felt like.”
“You think he’s alive?”
“I think someone wants me to think he is.”
I leaned back. The rain was getting louder. “Tell me the truth, Clara. You said you never went back after the fire.”
“I didn’t.”
“You’re lying.”
She looked up sharply.
“The super saw you. Last month. Apartment 3C. Same day someone torched the files in the basement.”
“I wasn’t—” She swallowed. “I didn’t start the fire.”
“But you were there.”
She leaned in, voice low. “You have no idea what he was into. What he left behind.”
“Then tell me.”
She hesitated, eyes flicking to the door like she expected someone to burst in.
Then: “It wasn’t just keys he hid. It was people.”
And just like that, I knew I’d already waited too long to walk away.
